# Geolocation-API

 - JavaScript supplies an API, the **Geolocation API**, that gives us a way to get, among other things, Latitude and Longitude.
 - With this, we can go to our favorite mapping software and display their location or store it in a database to be analyzed at a later stage.
 - Here we will only be concerned with Latitude and Longitude and viewing it in **OpenStreetMap**.
